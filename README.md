Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is diligently working to enhance the security measures of its existing application.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall well-being?
I thoroughly enjoyed static testing as it allowed me to spot any potential flaws in my code easily. Utilizing secure code is crucial for safeguarding both your property and that of your customers. If personal information or trade secrets are lost, individuals and companies can face significant financial losses. When it comes to maintaining a company's reputation over time, designing secure software is highly beneficial as it ensures the preservation of information and overall integrity.

What about working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
When it comes to verifying dependencies for vulnerabilities, the dependency check tool has proven to be incredibly beneficial. It enabled the discovery of vulnerabilities in a faster and more efficient manner.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Testing revealed that the majority of vulnerabilities stemmed from the use of outdated libraries. By replacing these libraries with more up-to-date ones, it is possible to create more secure software. Performing future penetration testing will enable a more precise assessment of the vulnerabilities present in the code.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
As I developed the program, I diligently ensured that all components function properly through regular debugging. Once the code was reworked, I conducted an extra vulnerability test to check for any potential new vulnerabilities.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

As a student, I frequently turned to online resources, like stack overflow, to find solutions to the issues I encountered in the console. It was helpful to see how others had tackled similar problems.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I utilize a hash function to securely transmit encrypted messages.
